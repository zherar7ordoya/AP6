Was it something that I said?
I tried my best
Yeah, all for you
I can see it in your eyes
The way you lie
I'm such a fool


One too many times
I'm the one to take the burden
Oh, you know I've tried
But got nothing
Got nothing


So, if I let down my guard
If I rip up my scars
And I show you my heart
Am I beautiful?
If I tell you my secrets
Show my dark and my demons
Tell me, what do you see?
Am I beautiful?


Am I beautiful?


Am I beautiful?


If I tell you my secrets
Show my dark and my demons
Tell me, what do you see?
Am I beautiful?


Am I beautiful?


They say the best way that you heal
Is to move on
To someone new


Then why does every single road
That I take
Lead back to you?


One too many times
I'm the one to take the burden
Oh, you know I've tried
But got nothing
Got nothing


So, if I let down my guard
If I rip up my scars
And I show you my heart
Am I beautiful?
If I tell you my secrets
Show my dark and my demons
Tell me, what do you see?
Am I beautiful?


Am I beautiful?


Am I beautiful?


Am I beautiful?


So, if I let down my guard
If I rip up my scars
And I show you my heart
Am I beautiful?
If I tell you my secrets
Show my dark and my demons
Tell me, what do you see?
Am I beautiful?
