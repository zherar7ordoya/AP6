We're riding down the boulevard
We're riding into the dark night, night
With half the tank and empty heart
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
As the silence filled the lonely air
Oh, how did we get here now now nah babe
We see a storm is closing in
Pretending we escape


Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on)


We're running all the red lights down
No way that we can stop now, now
A quarter tank and almost gone
Pretending we're in love, but it's never enough, nah
I wish we could take it back in time
Before we cross the line now, now, now, babe
We see a storm is closing in (oh, oh, oh)
I reach out for your hand


Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on), hold on
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (ooh, yeah)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (ooh, ooh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on), hold on


Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hold on, oh yeah, oh
Hold on


Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (oh, uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on), hold on
Don't say a word while we dance with the devil (uh)
You brought a fire to a world so cold (uh)
We're out of time on the highway to never
Hold on (hold on), hold on (hold on) yeah
