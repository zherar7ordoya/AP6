Cause you're a sky
Cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm going to give you my heart
Cause you're a sky, cause you're
A sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path


I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do 
Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you


Cause you're a sky, cause you're 
A sky full of stars 
I want to die in your arms
Cause you get lighter 
the more it gets dark
I'm going to give you my heart


And I don't care
Go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do 
Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you


You're a sky
You're a sky full of stars


Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
