# WinformsCSharp-ProjectDBS
A college project whilst on my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing course (2016/17). The project is  producing a three tier Winforms application using SQLServerDB and modular UserControls  through C# and .Net. 

The application is three tier in architecture as follows:
a) Pres (Presentation layer) including UserControls/Model/Local SQLServerDB
b) BIZ (Business Layer) for validation and processing purposes
c) DAL (Database Access Layer) for access to the relational DB (local on initial committ)

The Tech used was as follows:
a) Microsoft Visual Studios 2015
b) SQL Server 2014 interface with Visual Studios 
c) .Net including ADO.NET

Features include view students, add students, edit students, delete students and add new application user. User Controls and layers follow a good modular structure so they are resusable upon demand.
